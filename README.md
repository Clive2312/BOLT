# BOLT
This repository contains the evaluation code for the IEEE S&P 2024 paper: **BOLT: Privacy-Preserving, Accurate and Efficient Inference for Transformers**.

The implementation to reproduce the results in the paper can be found here: https://github.com/Clive2312/EzPC/tree/bert/SCI.
We will clean and merge the code to this repo.
